# NeoAsm

The **NeoASM Installer** is a robust and feature-rich tool designed to set up the NeoASM environment for high-performance assembly language processing, optimized for systems with **AMD Ryzen 3 Series 7000** CPUs and **Radeon Graphics**. This installer incorporates advanced system compatibility checks, efficient error handling, and performance optimization features, all tailored to leverage the unique hardware configuration of the user's system.

### **Key Features and Enhancements**:

1. **System Architecture Compatibility**:
   - **CPU Compatibility**: The installer ensures the system is running on an AMD Ryzen 3 Series 7000 CPU by checking the processor model through the `cpuinfo` library.
   - **GPU Compatibility**: The script checks for **Radeon Graphics** to ensure compatibility with the AMD ecosystem using `lspci`.

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - The installer checks for the required versions of critical libraries, such as **LLVM**, ensuring proper functionality of the NeoASM environment. If dependencies are missing or incompatible, the script will notify the user and halt the installation.

3. **AOT and Performance Optimizations**:
   - The installer configures **AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation** linked mappings, **string theory logic**, and **static frame-based structuring** for improved performance. This setup targets efficient memory management and CPU utilization.
   - The tool applies **register allocation**, **instruction scheduling**, and **memory alignment** optimizations to enhance CPU pipeline efficiency, reduce memory access overhead, and ensure that memory blocks are aligned to the CPU's cache line for faster access.

4. **Detailed Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error checks are embedded throughout the script, from verifying system compatibility to ensuring that necessary dependencies are correctly installed. Any failure is handled gracefully, with clear error messages and instructions.

5. **Cross-Platform Installation**:
   - The installer is designed to handle different operating systems (**Windows**, **Linux**, **macOS**), with specific installation steps for each platform. It automatically installs dependencies like LLVM, Git, and Python, based on the user's OS.

6. **Automated Setup**:
   - The installer creates necessary directories, downloads the NeoASM compiler from a Git repository, and configures the environment to ensure that everything is ready for use after installation. 

### **Steps in the Installation Process**:
1. **Check Python Version**: Ensures Python 3.7 or higher is installed.
2. **System Architecture Check**: Verifies the system is using compatible hardware (AMD Ryzen 3 7000 and Radeon Graphics).
3. **Install Dependencies**: Automatically installs required Python packages and checks for the required LLVM version.
4. **Create Necessary Directories**: Ensures required folders for binaries, libraries, and examples are created.
5. **Download the NeoASM Compiler**: Clones the NeoASM repository if not already available.
6. **Setup Runtime Environment**: Initializes AOT, string theory logic, and memory optimizations.
7. **Apply CPU Optimizations**: Configures register allocation, instruction scheduling, and memory alignment for maximum performance.
8. **Platform-Specific Installation**: Adjusts installation steps depending on the user's OS.
9. **Completion**: Once installation is successful, the user is ready to run NeoASM.

### **Usage**:
- The installer simplifies the setup process, automating most tasks, and ensures the system is fully optimized for the hardware configuration.
- After installation, users can run NeoASM by executing the command `neoasm` in their terminal, starting the compiler and assembly language processing environment.

### **Overall Goal**:
The NeoASM installer is designed to create a seamless, efficient, and error-free setup for users, ensuring that NeoASM runs optimally on systems with AMD Ryzen 3 Series 7000 CPUs and Radeon Graphics. It offers enhanced performance with AOT pre-structuring and optimizations tailored for the hardware, ensuring the best possible execution and assembly experience.
