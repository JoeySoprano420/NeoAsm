To create the neoasm language that integrates linked mapping, AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation, string theory logic, static frame-based solid-state pre-structuring, explicit defined semi-static typing, and rigid vertical checking, with ram-streamed packetized execution, we would define a multi-layered approach. This will blend low-level assembler-like structures with higher-level optimizations and runtime management for efficient execution.

Below is a conceptual structure that defines some of the key features you're aiming for:

1. Linked Mapping AOT
Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation is employed here. We will use a static memory model to pre-link all relevant structures, ensuring all modules and mappings are set up before runtime.

2. String Theory Logic
This defines a model for string-based operations, utilizing the idea of quantum entanglement for operations like string transformations or pattern matching, akin to quantum-like manipulations at the lowest level.

3. Static Frame-based Solid-state AOT Pre-Structuring
Pre-structuring refers to the static analysis of a program into predictable memory frame blocks that align with solid-state memory management principles (non-volatile, fast).

4. Explicit Defined Semi-static Typed
This introduces explicit type definitions with some flexibility in their structure. Semi-static means that types are defined but could be adjusted based on initial setup or contextual clues during execution.

5. Rigid Vertical Checking
A rigid checking mechanism is introduced at compile-time and runtime to validate memory addresses, variable states, and flow between static and dynamic components.

6. Ram-streamed Packetized Execution
Memory is managed in packetsâ€”streaming operations across RAM to optimize bandwidth. This execution style uses chunked or packetized memory blocks, reducing overhead when handling large or frequent computations.
